## DESCRIPTION

There are many markup and templating systems in the
world. Why be limited to just one? Neapolitan gives
you a whole box to pick from.


## FEATURES

* All the variety of a Whitman's Sampler.
* And all the ease of a Hershey's K.I.S.S.
* Our website has pretty colors :smile:


## Usage

Here's a very simple example of Neapolitan markup.

```neapolitan
--- !metadata
name: World
--- !markdown
Hello {{name}}!
```

Library usage:


```julia
import Neapolitan

Neapolitan.render(io_or_string)
```

## Compatability

Neapolitan has a little bitty bit of brains to make static blog writers
life easier. If your Neapolitan markup does not provide tags, the library
will take a smart guess at the content. That means traditional Jekyll
style posts/pages with YAML from matter followed by Markdown text will
work!


```neapolitan
---
name: World
---
Hello {{name}}!
```

This will work just like the prior example.


## Installation


Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  neapolitan:
    github: trans/neapolitan.cr
